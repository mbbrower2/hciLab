                Dr. Hirshfield’s research explores the use of non-invasive brain
                measurement to passively classify users’ social, cognitive, and
                affective states in order to enhance usability testing and
                adaptive system design. She works primarily with functional
                near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new
                non-invasive brain imaging device that is safe, portable, robust
                to noise, which can be implemented wirelessly; making it ideal
                for research in human-computer interaction. The high density
                fNIRS equipment in Hirshfield’s lab provides rich
                spatio-temporal data that is well suited as input into deep
                neural networks and other advanced machine learning algorithms.
                A primary tenet of Hirshfield’s machine learning research
                involves building and labeling large cross-participant,
                cross-task fNIRS training datasets in order to build robust and
                generalizable models that can avoid overfitting and succeed in
                ecologically valid environments outside the lab. More

                Orit Shaer is the Class of 1966 Associate Professor of Computer
                Science and co-director of the Media Arts and Sciences Program
                at Wellesley College. She found and directs the Wellesley
                College Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab. Her research
                focuses on next generation user interfaces including virtual and
                augmented reality, tangible, gestural, tactile, and multi touch
                interaction. Current projects funded by the National Science
                Foundation (NSF) and by industry grants include the design and
                evaluation of novel human-machine interfaces for supporting
                productivity in highly-automated vehicles, the development of
                new interactive visualizations for personal -omics, and the
                conceptualization and prototyping of computational tools for
                enhancing learning and innovation in bio-design. Shaer received
                her PhD and MSc in Computer Science from Tufts University. She
                has been a research fellow in the Design Machine Group at the
                University of Washington and in the University College London
                Interaction Center. More information can be found on his

                An academic who turned to the industry, he has been involved in
                Software Design and Development for the better part of his life.
                From teaching about it, to consulting, to designing and
                developing software, he has gathered experience from many
                different parts of the software world. Recently he has been
                exploring the world of Typescript and has used Angular and
                NestJs for a huge project that he is doing by myself, from DB
                design to implementation and deployment. And he has combined
                that with flutter mobile development for the mobile app
                counterpart! His research revolves around business process
                improvement, digital branding and automation, and using video
                game motivational aspects in various other fields, such as
                business, healthcare, training and education.
