						<h3> Rob Jacob </h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/rob_jacob.jpg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Robert Jacob is a Professor of Computer Science at
							Tufts
							University, where his research interests are new interaction modes and techniques and user
							interface software; his current work focuses on implicit brain-computer interfaces. More
							information including how to contact can be found at his <a style="text-decoration: underline;"

						<h3> Anes Kim</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/anes_kim.jpeg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Anes is a second year Ph.D. student in the joint
							program for
							computer science and cognitive
							science. Her research interest in brain-computer interfaces and cognitive science stems from
							how
							the human brain can be represented as a computer, but also how a computer can mimic that
							human
							brain and its processing capabilities. She is currently working on a couple of projects. The
							first involves evaluating cognitive workload with multi-modal physiological sensors under
							multi-tasking conditions, and the other investigates the effectiveness of various visual and
							text presentation formats, such as confusion matrices, used in Bayesian conditional
							probability
							problems.</p>

						<h3> Anna Sheaffer</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/anna_sheaffer.jpeg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Anna is a second year PhD student in Computer
							Science at Tufts. She is interested in using fNIRS to detect metacognitive states to enhance
							user experience. Previously, she has worked on developing systems with various physiological
							sensors to detect mental workload while a participant is standing and walking.</p>

						<h3> Maddie Brower</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/maddie_brower.jpeg"
								style="max-width: 200px; height: auto;" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Maddie is a first year Computer Science PhD student
							at Tufts University. Currently, Maddie is looking into how we can use fNIRS data to
							individualize transcranial electrical stimulation to improve motor learning and/or motor
							performance. Before coming to Tufts, Maddie worked in industry primarily as a software engineer.</p>
