						<h3> Rob Jacob </h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/rob_jacob.jpg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Robert Jacob is a Professor of Computer Science at
							Tufts
							University, where his research interests are new interaction modes and techniques and user
							interface software; his current work focuses on implicit brain-computer interfaces. More information including how to contact can be found at his <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/">website.</a></p>

						<h3> Anes Kim</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/anes_kim.jpeg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Anes is a second year Ph.D. student in the joint
							program for
							computer science and cognitive
							science. Her research interest in brain-computer interfaces and cognitive science stems from
							how
							the human brain can be represented as a computer, but also how a computer can mimic that
							human
							brain and its processing capabilities. She is currently working on a couple of projects. The
							first involves evaluating cognitive workload with multi-modal physiological sensors under
							multi-tasking conditions, and the other investigates the effectiveness of various visual and
							text presentation formats, such as confusion matrices, used in Bayesian conditional
							probability
							problems.</p>

						<h3> Anna Sheaffer</h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/people_images/anna_sheaffer.jpeg" alt=""></span>
						<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0;">Anna Sheaffer is a PhD student in Computer Science
							at Tufts University, where she focuses on Human-Computer Interaction and Brain-Computer
							Interfaces under the advisement of Professor Robert Jacob. Her work sits at the intersection
							of cognitive science and computing, exploring innovative ways humans interact with
							technology. Beyond academics and athletics, Anna was a Citizen Scholar who co-led a
							meaningful campus project—creating a COVID-19 time capsule to preserve the experiences of
							the Class of 2024, which she described as "lost to the pandemic." The project, which
							included a mosaic of masks and archived materials, reflected her commitment to community and
							documenting history as it unfolded.
							Now at Tufts, Anna continues to bridge her interests in cognitive science and computing,
							working on cutting-edge research in brain-computer interfaces and how people interact with
							emerging technologies.</p>
