					<p> The current focus in my research group is on a new generation of "implicit" brain-computer
						interfaces. They allow a computer to obtain and act on auxiliary inputs from its user without
						requiring explicit user action or attention. Brain-computer interaction has made dramatic
						progress, but its main application to date has been for physically disabled users. Our work in
						real-time measurement and machine learning classification of functional near infrared
						spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain data is allows to create, use, and study new kinds of implicit user
						interfaces based on brain measurement.<br><br>

						We are using brain input as a way to obtain more information about the user and their context in
						an effortless and direct way from their brain activity. We then use it to adapt the user
						interface in real time. We are creating and studying these new user interfaces, with emphasis on
						domains where we can measure their efficacy.

					<h4>Investigating Effects of Mental Workload Manipulation during Motion Using Multimodel Sensors

					<p>
						The one subgroup of effort for which physiological
						measurement remains elusive is mental effort or mental workload, which can be measured using a
						variety of modalities (Krigolson et al., 2017; Nourbakhsh et al., 2012; Herff et al., 2014).
						<br> <br>
						The purpose of this study is to quantify the neural (e.g. changes in blood oxygenation using
						Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and/or changes in electrical activity using
						Electroencephalography), physiological (e.g. changes in eye movements or other motion
						artifacts),
						and behavioral (i.e., cognitive task performance) effects of mental workload manipulations on
						participants while they are in motion.

					<h4>An Implicit Dialogue Injection System for Interruption Management

						Worked towards redesigning the conventional
						on/off interruption management tactic (a.k.a. “Do Not Disturb
						Mode”) for situations where interruptions are inevitable. We intro-
						duced an implicit dialogue injection system, in which the computer
						implicitly observed the user’s state of busyness from passive mea-
						surement of the prefrontal cortex to determine how to interrupt the
						user.

						Developed Brain Automated Chorales (BACh), an adaptive
						brain-computer system that dynamically increased the levels
						of difficulty in a musical learning task based on pianists’ cog-
						nitive workload measured by functional near-infrared spec-

					<p>
						We used functional near-infrared
						spectroscopy (fNIRS) to obtain passive brain sensing data
						and detect extended periods of boredom or overload. From
						these physiological signals, we adapted a simulation in or-
						der to optimize workload in real-time, which allowed the sys-
						tem to better fit the task to the user from moment to moment.
						<br> <br>
						We ran a laboratory study
						in which participants performed path planning for multiple
						unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a simulation. Based on
						their state, we varied the difficulty of the task by adding or removing UAVs and found that we
						were able to decrease er-
						rors by 35% over a baseline condition
