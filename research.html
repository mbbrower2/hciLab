				<h2> Research Areas </h2>
				<div class="row" id="researchArea">
					<p> The current focus in my research group is on a new generation of "implicit" brain-computer
						interfaces. They allow a computer to obtain and act on auxiliary inputs from its user without
						requiring explicit user action or attention. Brain-computer interaction has made dramatic
						progress, but its main application to date has been for physically disabled users. Our work in
						real-time measurement and machine learning classification of functional near infrared
						spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain data is allows to create, use, and study new kinds of implicit user
						interfaces based on brain measurement.<br><br>

						We are using brain input as a way to obtain more information about the user and their context in
						an effortless and direct way from their brain activity. We then use it to adapt the user
						interface in real time. We are creating and studying these new user interfaces, with emphasis on
						domains where we can measure their efficacy.

					<h4>Investigating Effects of Mental Workload Manipulation during Motion Using Multimodel Sensors

					<p>
						The one subgroup of effort for which physiological
						measurement remains elusive is mental effort or mental workload, which can be measured using a
						variety of modalities (Krigolson et al., 2017; Nourbakhsh et al., 2012; Herff et al., 2014).
						<br> <br>
						The purpose of this study is to quantify the neural (e.g. changes in blood oxygenation using
						Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and/or changes in electrical activity using
						Electroencephalography), physiological (e.g. changes in eye movements or other motion
						artifacts),
						and behavioral (i.e., cognitive task performance) effects of mental workload manipulations on
						participants while they are in motion.
